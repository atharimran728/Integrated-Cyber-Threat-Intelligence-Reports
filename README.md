# Integrated-Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-Reports
This repository contains the five reports that were created for a scenario in which a company is attacked by Malware. This assignment the part of the Bytewise Fellowship in Cybersecurity.


## Scenario:
### Background:
TechGuard Inc., a major cybersecurity solutions provider with a diverse client base spanning financial services, healthcare, and critical infrastructure sectors, has recently been hit by a sophisticated and multi-faceted cyber attack. The attack appears to be part of a large-scale, coordinated campaign orchestrated by a well-resourced advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as “Specter.”

### Incident Details:

1. **Initial Indicators:** The attack began with a series of highly targeted spear-phishing emails sent to key employees in the finance and operations departments. These emails contained a malicious link that led to a compromised external document storage service. Once clicked, the link deployed a multi-stage malware payload.

### Malware Characteristics:

1. **Stage 1 - Initial Access:**
 The initial malware, “SpecterDrop,” is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that establishes a foothold on the victim's machine. It uses sophisticated social engineering to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and gain unauthorized access to corporate accounts.
2. **Stage 2 - Lateral Movement:** Once inside the network, “SpecterDrop” communicates with additional payloads, including “ShadowFrost,” which is designed to exfiltrate sensitive data and conduct lateral movement across the network. The malware uses a combination of legitimate administrative tools and custom exploitation techniques to escalate privileges and evade detection.
3. **Stage 3 - Data Exfiltration and Sabotage:** The final stage involves data exfiltration using encrypted channels and deploying ransomware, “FrostLock,” to encrypt critical files and demand a ransom. The ransomware is accompanied by a destructive payload that aims to sabotage backup systems.


### Current Situation:

1. **Compromised Systems:**
Several critical systems, including financial transaction systems, customer databases, and internal communication channels, are showing signs of unauthorized access and data manipulation.
2. **Alerts and Evidence:**
 Security monitoring systems have detected unusual outbound traffic, data exfiltration patterns, and ransomware encryption activities. However, the malware has employed advanced obfuscation techniques, making it difficult to analyze and remediate.


### Challenges:

1. **Complex Attack Vectors:**
    The attack utilizes multiple stages and evasion techniques, making it difficult to track and mitigate. Additionally, the attackers have used sophisticated encryption and anti-forensic measures.
2. **Internal and External Stakeholders:**
  The attack affects not only TechGuard Inc. but also its clients. Coordinating with affected clients and managing external communications is crucial.
3. **Regulatory and Compliance Issues:**
 The incident raises compliance concerns due to the potential breach of sensitive client data, requiring careful consideration of legal and regulatory obligations.
